The genomic variant c.259A>G p.Ile87Val rs571414497 is located in the ALOXE3 gene, which encodes for the enzyme arachidonate lipoxygenase 3. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids to form part of the lipid barrier of the skin, playing a critical role in the maintenance of skin barrier function and integrity. Mutations in ALOXE3 have been associated with hereditary ichthyosis, a group of disorders characterized by dry, thickened, and scaly skin.The c.259A>G variant results in the substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 87 of the ALOXE3 protein (p.Ile87Val). This missense mutation may affect the enzyme's function, potentially leading to the clinical manifestations of hereditary ichthyosis. However, the specific paper provided does not detail the pathogenicity or the clinical significance of this particular variant within the context of hereditary ichthyosis. Therefore, further investigation and functional studies would be required to determine the impact of the p.Ile87Val variant on ALOXE3 enzyme activity and its contribution to the disease phenotype.Given the importance of ALOXE3 in skin barrier function, variants that alter the enzyme's activity could have significant implications for individuals carrying the mutation, potentially necessitating genetic counseling and consideration of reproductive planning for affected families. The paper cited does not mention the c.259A>G p.Ile87Val rs571414497 variant specifically, but it does highlight the utility of whole exome sequencing (WES) in identifying pathogenic variants in genes associated with hereditary ichthyosis, which could include ALOXE3 [1].
