The genomic variant c.2T>A p.Met1? rs1170153450 is located in the ASCL1 gene, which encodes the Achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1), a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the determination and differentiation of neuronal precursors in the developing nervous system. ASCL1 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression associated with neurogenesis and has been implicated in the development of certain types of neuroendocrine tumors due to its role in the differentiation of neural and neuroendocrine cells.The c.2T>A variant results in the loss of the canonical start codon (ATG to AAG), which is predicted to lead to a start lost mutation. This type of mutation can have significant effects on the protein since it may prevent the initiation of translation, potentially leading to a complete loss of protein function or the production of a truncated protein with compromised activity. Given the essential role of ASCL1 in neuronal development, such a mutation could have profound implications for normal neural function and development.The rs1170153450 identifier is a reference SNP cluster ID that provides a means to track the variant across different genomic databases and research studies. However, the papers provided do not contain specific information regarding the functional impact or clinical significance of this particular variant in the ASCL1 gene, nor do they mention the variant directly. Therefore, further studies would be required to elucidate the precise consequences of the c.2T>A p.Met1? variant on ASCL1 function and its potential association with disease phenotypes.
