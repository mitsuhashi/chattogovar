The genomic variant c.2722G>C p.Gly908Arg rs796052984 on the SCN1A gene is a missense mutation that results in the substitution of glycine with arginine at the 908th amino acid position. This variant was identified in a patient (P21) who presented with developmental delay (DD) and was characterized by early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), which is a severe form of epilepsy that begins in infancy [1]. The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the type 1 voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.1), which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to a variety of epilepsy syndromes, including Dravet syndrome (DS), generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), and other forms of epilepsy characterized by febrile seizures.The c.2722G>C variant has been submitted to ClinVar with mixed interpretations of pathogenicity, including one submission classified as pathogenic and three with uncertain significance. This discrepancy in classification underscores the complexity of variant interpretation and the need for further functional studies or additional evidence to clarify the clinical relevance of this specific mutation.Given the established role of SCN1A in neuronal excitability and the association of other mutations in this gene with epilepsy syndromes, the c.2722G>C p.Gly908Arg variant is likely to have functional consequences that contribute to the patient's neurological phenotype. However, the exact mechanism by which this amino acid change affects the function of the Nav1.1 channel remains to be elucidated. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of this variant on channel function and its contribution to the clinical manifestations observed in the patient.
