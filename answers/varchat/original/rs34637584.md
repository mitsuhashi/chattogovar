The LRRK2 gene encodes for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, a serine-threonine protein kinase that belongs to the ROCO protein family and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the immune response and autophagy. The c.6055G>A p.Gly2019Ser rs34637584 variant in the LRRK2 gene, commonly referred to as p.G2019S, is a missense mutation that results in the substitution of glycine with serine at position 2019 of the protein. This variant has been widely associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and is known to increase kinase activity of LRRK2, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease [1][2][3][4][5].The p.G2019S variant is particularly prevalent in certain populations, accounting for over 30% of PD cases in Tunisian Arab-Berber individuals and is also common in Ashkenazi Jews and North African Arab-Berbers. It has been suggested that carriers of this variant are descendants of a common ancestral founder, with the allele estimated to have originated at least 40 generations ago. The variant demonstrates incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, which indicates that other genetic or environmental factors may modulate the clinical manifestation of PD in carriers [1].In addition to its association with PD, the p.G2019S variant has been linked to an elevated risk of certain cancers, including colon cancer. Experimental models have shown that the variant promotes pathogenesis of colon cancer, characterized by increased tumor number and size, and enhances intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and inflammation within the tumor microenvironment [2].At the cellular level, the p.G2019S variant has been shown to induce mitochondrial DNA damage and affect mitochondrial dynamics, which may contribute to the neurodegenerative processes observed in PD. The variant also influences the structure-function relationships in human cortical neural networks, leading to aberrant morphology and heightened metabolic demand [3][5].Furthermore, the LRRK2 p.G2019S variant has been implicated in the immune response, with carriers showing increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is hypothesized that the variant's impact on the innate immune system may influence the penetrance of PD, as LRRK2 is highly expressed in immune cells and can be induced upon stimulation with pro-inflammatory signals or pathogen exposure [1].Overall, the c.6055G>A p.Gly2019Ser rs34637584 variant in the LRRK2 gene is a significant genetic factor in PD, with implications for immune system function and potential links to cancer pathogenesis. The variant's high prevalence in specific populations and its impact on kinase activity make it a focal point for understanding the genetic underpinnings of PD and exploring targeted therapeutic interventions [1][2][3][4][5].
