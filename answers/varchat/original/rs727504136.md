The genomic variant c.3733C>T p.Arg1245Ter rs727504136 in the SCN1A gene is a pathogenic mutation characterized by the substitution of a cytosine for a thymine at nucleotide position 3733, which results in the introduction of a premature stop codon at arginine 1245 (p.Arg1245Ter). This variant has been associated with Dravet syndrome (DS), a severe form of epilepsy with onset in infancy that includes febrile seizures and a spectrum of other seizure types leading to neurodevelopmental delays [2][5][6]. The variant has been classified as pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria, which includes very strong evidence of pathogenicity (PVS1), strong evidence (PS4_Mod), and moderate evidence (PM2_SUP) [2]. This classification is supported by the observation that the variant has been reported in multiple unrelated individuals with Dravet syndrome and is absent from controls [2][5].The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na_v1.1, which is critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to altered channel function, affecting the excitability of neurons and resulting in the clinical manifestations of epilepsy and related neurodevelopmental disorders.The c.3733C>T variant has been reported in several patients with Dravet syndrome, presenting with early-onset febrile seizures and a range of other seizure types, as well as developmental delays and, in some cases, features of autism [5][6]. The variant has been identified as de novo in multiple cases, which is consistent with the typical inheritance pattern of Dravet syndrome where most cases are sporadic due to de novo mutations [5][6].Furthermore, the c.3733C>T variant has been implicated in cases with co-morbid mitochondrial disease, where patients exhibited defects in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex activity alongside the clinical features of Dravet syndrome [6]. This suggests a potential overlap in the pathophysiological mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and sodium channelopathy in these patients.In summary, the c.3733C>T p.Arg1245Ter rs727504136 variant in the SCN1A gene is a pathogenic stop-gained mutation associated with Dravet syndrome, characterized by early-onset febrile seizures, a spectrum of other seizure types, and developmental delays. The mutation results in a truncated protein product, likely leading to loss of function of the Na_v1.1 channel, which plays a crucial role in neuronal excitability and the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
