The genomic variant c.4423G>A p.Gly1475Arg rs796053216 on the SCN8A gene has been associated with a spectrum of neurological phenotypes, particularly epilepsy and intellectual disability (IDD). This missense mutation results in the substitution of glycine with arginine at the 1475th amino acid position of the protein encoded by SCN8A [1]. The SCN8A gene encodes the voltage-gated sodium-channel type VIII alpha subunit (NaV1.6), which plays a critical role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons [6].The variant has been identified in patients presenting with epilepsy and IDD, with some individuals experiencing clusters of seizures followed by regression of developmental milestones [1]. The clinical presentation of individuals with this variant can vary, but SCN8A mutations are often associated with moderate-to-severe IDD and/or autistic traits [1]. The Gly1475Arg variant has been reported in multiple cases, suggesting that it may be a recurrent mutation [8]. Moreover, the variant has been observed in patients who presented with an intermediate SCN8A-related epilepsy with mild cognitive impairment, which in the majority is a treatable epilepsy [8].The functional implications of the Gly1475Arg variant are significant, as the SCN8A gene product is critical for the proper functioning of neuronal circuits. NaV1.6 channels are highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the nodes of Ranvier of myelinated axons and the axon initial segments (AIS), where they are essential for the initiation of action potentials [6]. Mutations in SCN8A can lead to alterations in channel function, which can manifest as various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. The Gly1475Arg variant is located in a domain that is important for the inactivation of the channel, which is a crucial aspect of channel function and neuronal excitability [9].The c.4423G>A p.Gly1475Arg variant has been classified as pathogenic in ClinVar, with multiple submissions supporting this classification. This evidence, combined with the clinical data from patients and the critical role of SCN8A in neuronal function, underscores the importance of this variant in the pathogenesis of SCN8A-related disorders.
